# Project Euler, problem #27
# Considering quadratics of the form:
#     n^2+an+b, where |a|<1000 and |b|≤1000
# where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
# e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4
# Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression
# that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
